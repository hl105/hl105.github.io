### Are women evil? Hacking Google’s search results:


[https://medium.com/@enimust/are-women-evil-hacking-googles-search-results-eebfbbffe179](https://medium.com/@enimust/are-women-evil-hacking-googles-search-results-eebfbbffe179)


→ In 2017, Google suggested evil to autocomplete the query “Are women __”. Why did this happen? The article that appears on the top of the search query contain the phrase many times and contain other signals that may have caused the autocomplete to happen. Thus the article suggests the use of “nutrition labels” for search results. The users can read the labels like “Who was the article written by?” or “Is this a reliable source?” and decide on their own whether the information is credible or not. After this article was written, Google implemented a feature (the three vertical dots icon) where when clicked, the information about the website is displayed. However, let’s be truthful — who clicks on those dots? It will be faster for the users to go to the page, quickly scan it, and get out if it is unsatisfactory. What would be an easier, faster way to let the users know the credibility of a website? This question remains to be answered.


### Presidents in the Clan. SEO techniques to hack history: 


[https://medium.com/@enimust/presidents-in-the-klan-seo-techniques-to-hack-history-953e48dc413c](https://medium.com/@enimust/presidents-in-the-klan-seo-techniques-to-hack-history-953e48dc413c)


→ This example clearly shows how there is a clear path to exploiting the Google search algorithm to get better rankings on the search result page. This particular example about the presidents in the Klan ended up in the best position possible — the featured snippet section. In high school, I wrote an article about a very niche field (cultural appropriation in Korea written in English). The next week, my article was in the Google snippet! I remember being very excited and texting a lot of friends. I still wonder what part of my article made it appear there, in bold, looking very important. Maybe it was the sources I cited, or the addition of a Korean translation, or the date it was created. Anyways, this blog post also cites some options that may have influenced the article full of fake news making it to the featured snippet. It also suggests some labels that could have prevented this from happening — maybe add an author, or some information about the article. Again, Google later implemented such a feature with the three dots that no one really clicks. 


### The fake news story that fooled even Maggie Haberman:

→ How do I know whether a story that is going viral on Instagram, TikTok, etc. is fake news or not? I think about this question on a daily basis, probably because I spend a lot of time (I try to use screen time.. ) on Instagram and discover just scrolling through whatever Instagram thinks I am interested in. When there is a “breaking news” story that I haven’t seen in the New York Times or anywhere that is confirmed to be credible, I first check the 1. number of comments (because one out of the 300 comments must have looked it up for me, right?), 2. the date (if the news is from a year ago but claims to be breaking news, it’s not), and content (are the documents, pictures, etc). But last month, when an Instagram post told me Tom Holland and Zendaya were getting married, I thought it was real — people were congratulating them in the comment section, the date was from yesterday, and there was a cute couple picture on the post! But I was too lazy to open Safari and triple-check, so I started spreading the news until my sister told me it was fake news. Oh well. So what feature would have stopped me from believing these two top Hollywood stars are getting married? Maybe an app that extracts text from a screenshot and tells me verified information about it? What easy verification methods are there that are easier than clicking three dots…

- The information panels on Google and Facebook: [https://medium.com/@enimust/the-information-panels-on-google-and-facebook-uncovering-their-blind-spots-2e8210b2e697](https://medium.com/@enimust/the-information-panels-on-google-and-facebook-uncovering-their-blind-spots-2e8210b2e697)

→ We all know that some links on Google search results are sketchy. We make sure to check the .gov pages when we are looking for traveler information, or .edu pages when we are looking for academic information. However, I don’t think I’ve ever questioned the information on the right-side info box. It just seemed right from the start, the one-sentence summary about whatever organization or website I was looking for. This article showed me that I was wrong — I looked up some of the celebrities with criminal records that I know, and it seems like their one-line description is just their Wikipedia page introduction.

→ “Eat at least one small rock daily!” Says who? Geologists at UC Berkeley! This is what Google SGE told its users who searched “How many rocks should I eat.” This result, while it may be funny, is problematic because it cites some sources with some author that seems pretty credible. However, no UC Berkeley geologist said that — the source is The Onion, where the sources are made up for fun. But AI can’t tell whether humans should eat rocks or not. It saw a popular website with a lot of traffic, with sources and clear explanations, and decided to use it. While it is an attempt for Google to try to “label” its links, it does the job poorly and leads to more confusion for its users with its new AI feature.
