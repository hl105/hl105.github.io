Thoughts on Roger Penrose’s  interview: Is Mathematics Invented or Discovered?


Link to interview: [https://www.whyarewehere.tv/people/roger-penrose/](https://www.whyarewehere.tv/people/roger-penrose/)


### Is mathematics something that we discover or just something that we're making up?


> RP: Now, you see, the thing is, what's deep about it is that if you introduce this notion ‒ which at first sight looks like an invention ‒ it unfolds an entire world that you had no conception of, and you didn't invent that: that came as a gift.


 In middle school I used to feel _bad_ for imaginary numbers; the little i seemed so lonely alone, not being able to join its real number friends unless it found another imaginary number i to join. This interview brings me back to this memory, but with a different point of view; the imaginary number now reminds me of Hagrid from Harry Potter, who led the young boy to the world of magic. When Hagrid shows up on his doorstep, Harry realizes the wizarding world has always coexisted with the muggle world. At this moment, he revisits all the unexplainable, crazy events that had intruded his life — like the snake talking — as long as he could remember. Would it have been possible for Harry to wake up one day and the idea of a wizarding world where a bad guy called Voldemort trying to kill him to suddenly strike him? No. But Harry could have reached platform 9 3/4 without Hagrid. He could have managed to snatch the Hogwarts letter before uncle Vernon did, or he could have learned to control and use his magic skills alone. In one way or the other, he would have arrived at the same destination that is the wizarding world. Likewise, we could have decided on a different way to define the square root of minus one, instead of the i we have right now. But that invention would have also opened up a new world of quantum mechanics too, just like how the imaginary number i did. 


> Number theory? Does that have any relevance to the physical world? Maybe, we don't know. There's no particular importance, maybe a few odd things, but nothing of really great importance which seems to have developed in the physical world – that may be a temporary thing.


It’s interesting how Number theory has become so important and widely used in computer science, in fields like crypotgraphy and alogirhtm design. One of the first cs class I took was called “Mathematics for Computer Science” where we went over number theory (fermat’s little theorem! Counting! RSA!) extensively.


> RP: I think that's not the way I would look at things completely. You see it's all to do with this consciousness issue, and I think something else comes in which is outside the science that we presently know. It doesn't mean it's outside science. So you see, when you're asking me is it all science, well, science is limited at the moment, because it only deals with certain areas which don't include that. 


What divides natural and supernatural? Why do humans choose to put their faith in a supernatural realm, beyond our universe, when all that we percieve is the natural world? Is it also an invention that we created to reach beyond our physical perceptions, like how the imaginary number revealed the quantum world to us? Maybe then both faith and mathematics are just two differnet methods to reach the same destination.
