1. **connectivity**:

	dementia = losing track of k (how many edges we have used so far) in dp, depression = negative weight cycle

2. **induction**:

	you firmly believe in what happened before, your experiences, then build upon your memories to get the n+1th, your next step

3. **abstraction:**

	maybe the world we see is a highly abstracted world — especially when the moments where we say “i know what you mean” — the beauty of mathematics come from abstraction. 


	autoencoders: you close your eyes, try to remember your surroundings — do you remember every single detail? No, you just have “blobs” with some prominent features. It’s the same when we close our eyes for the last time. Maybe our memories are encoded into a tiny latent space, our spirit, to be decoded later

4. **abstract algebra:**

	abelian, the simple condition that the eq stays the same after switching the order is a crazy useful fact. ex) fundamental thm of finite abelian groups

5. **supernode**:

	when you don’t know where to start, zoom _out_ and look at the whole picture

6. I’m glad that our first widely used ai chatbot isn’t correct all the time
7. **waitpid**: helicopter parents
8. **np hard problems**: sometimes, problems need to be hard
9. **center Z(G)**: in group theory they are the ones that commute with all elements, i.e., they are the ones that stand firm. Even though they meet the same person in a different position, they still have the same value
10. The number 80 feels so small, but 80 years feels so long. 80 years can be replaced with 672,768,000 breaths. A lifetime feels so long. Can our brains truly understand infinity?
