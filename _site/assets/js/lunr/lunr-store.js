        "excerpt":"A few days ago, I asked myself why I’ve been writing my random thoughts on my Notion page instead of this blog. The conclusion: it’s just too much work writing in markdown, creating a file with a specific format, and uploading it. So I created a quick notion to blog direct conversion pipeline!

        "excerpt":"Are women evil? Hacking Google’s search results:   https://medium.com/@enimust/are-women-evil-hacking-googles-search-results-eebfbbffe179   → In 2017, Google suggested evil to autocomplete the query “Are women __”. Why did this happen? The article that appears on the top of the search query contain the phrase many times and contain other signals that may have caused the autocomplete to happen. Thus the article suggests the use of “nutrition labels” for search results. The users can read the labels like “Who was the article written by?” or “Is this a reliable source?” and decide on their own whether the information is credible or not. After this article was written, Google implemented a feature (the three vertical dots icon) where when clicked, the information about the website is displayed. However, let’s be truthful — who clicks on those dots? It will be faster for the users to go to the page, quickly scan it, and get out if it is unsatisfactory. What would be an easier, faster way to let the users know the credibility of a website? This question remains to be answered.   Presidents in the Clan. SEO techniques to hack history:   https://medium.com/@enimust/presidents-in-the-klan-seo-techniques-to-hack-history-953e48dc413c   → This example clearly shows how there is a clear path to exploiting the Google search algorithm to get better rankings on the search result page. This particular example about the presidents in the Klan ended up in the best position possible — the featured snippet section. In high school, I wrote an article about a very niche field (cultural appropriation in Korea written in English). The next week, my article was in the Google snippet! I remember being very excited and texting a lot of friends. I still wonder what part of my article made it appear there, in bold, looking very important. Maybe it was the sources I cited, or the addition of a Korean translation, or the date it was created. Anyways, this blog post also cites some options that may have influenced the article full of fake news making it to the featured snippet. It also suggests some labels that could have prevented this from happening — maybe add an author, or some information about the article. Again, Google later implemented such a feature with the three dots that no one really clicks.   The fake news story that fooled even Maggie Haberman:   https://medium.com/@enimust/the-fake-news-story-that-fooled-even-maggie-haberman-c22453c47169   → How do I know whether a story that is going viral on Instagram, TikTok, etc. is fake news or not? I think about this question on a daily basis, probably because I spend a lot of time (I try to use screen time.. ) on Instagram and discover just scrolling through whatever Instagram thinks I am interested in. When there is a “breaking news” story that I haven’t seen in the New York Times or anywhere that is confirmed to be credible, I first check the 1. number of comments (because one out of the 300 comments must have looked it up for me, right?), 2. the date (if the news is from a year ago but claims to be breaking news, it’s not), and content (are the documents, pictures, etc). But last month, when an Instagram post told me Tom Holland and Zendaya were getting married, I thought it was real — people were congratulating them in the comment section, the date was from yesterday, and there was a cute couple picture on the post! But I was too lazy to open Safari and triple-check, so I started spreading the news until my sister told me it was fake news. Oh well. So what feature would have stopped me from believing these two top Hollywood stars are getting married? Maybe an app that extracts text from a screenshot and tells me verified information about it? What easy verification methods are there that are easier than clicking three dots…      The information panels on Google and Facebook: https://medium.com/@enimust/the-information-panels-on-google-and-facebook-uncovering-their-blind-spots-2e8210b2e697   → We all know that some links on Google search results are sketchy. We make sure to check the .gov pages when we are looking for traveler information, or .edu pages when we are looking for academic information. However, I don’t think I’ve ever questioned the information on the right-side info box. It just seemed right from the start, the one-sentence summary about whatever organization or website I was looking for. This article showed me that I was wrong — I looked up some of the celebrities with criminal records that I know, and it seems like their one-line description is just their Wikipedia page introduction.   More articles on Google search results (will read this weekend):      Are Google’s Top Stories biased? It’s complicated. https://medium.com/@enimust/are-googles-top-stories-politically-biased-it-s-complicated-e9c68e269ed9   It’s a Google drenched society, but we still suffer from information-drought: https://medium.com/@enimust/its-a-google-drenched-society-but-we-still-suffer-from-an-information-drought-4be35132b3d5   Google AI &amp; Health: https://ipscell.com/2024/05/google-ai-overviews-on-stem-cells-are-a-bust-so-far-endanger-public-health/   NYT article on Google’s AI overview feature: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/technology/google-ai-overview-search.html   → “Eat at least one small rock daily!” Says who? Geologists at UC Berkeley! This is what Google SGE told its users who searched “How many rocks should I eat.” This result, while it may be funny, is problematic because it cites some sources with some author that seems pretty credible. However, no UC Berkeley geologist said that — the source is The Onion, where the sources are made up for fun. But AI can’t tell whether humans should eat rocks or not. It saw a popular website with a lot of traffic, with sources and clear explanations, and decided to use it. While it is an attempt for Google to try to “label” its links, it does the job poorly and leads to more confusion for its users with its new AI feature.     ","categories": ["project"],

Four datasets:                    a survey of eligible U.S. voters about their information needs ahead of the 2018 U.S. elections           a dataset of biased political phrases used in a large-scale Google audit ahead of   the 2018 U.S. election           Google’s “related searches” phrases for two groups of political candidates in the 2018 U.S. election (one group is composed entirely of women)           autocomplete suggestions and result pages for a set of searches on the day of a statewide election in the U.S. state of Virginia in 2019.                       Introduction:                    motivation: Trump lost the popular vote in 2016, but Google cited a conspiracy blog and claimed Trump won on the top search result page for the query “final vote count 2016”           Why is auditing necessary?                            Unlike Twitter which alerted its users of false content generated by Russia’s Internet Research Agency, Google simply fixes the problem without the same transparency. How many users searched for the problematic query? How did they fix it?               some might say it’s a protective measure — what if the hackers exploit the solution to improve their methods? → the lack of exposure of disinformation on the web is harmful to the public — e.g. Dylan Roof’s hate crime that started from searching “black on white crime” on Google. (Data void)                                   Three methods to detect political bias on search platforms:                            Third-party manipulation:                                    “Google bombing” in the early 2000s                                               Ranking Bias                                    “search engine manipulation effect”, tied to “filter bubbles”                                               ecosystem bias                                    consider the complexity of search platforms — users, content providers, ranking, etc.                                                                   How should we design search engine audits that are voter-centric?                            theory of “information cues”: voters prefer to take shortcuts to get informed about elections.               biased searches: need to come from voters themselves               beyond Candidate Names: voters first search who are the candidates → then modify the search so that they are more specfic               unreliable localization: ___ “near me” ← localized suggestions                                   conclusion: future search engine audits go beyond identifying whether their ranking algorithms are biased, but instead, take a broader ecosystem approach.

RQ1, RQ2: A novel audit of the Google’s Top stories panel that pro-   vides insights into its algorithmic choices for selecting and ranking news publishers.                    1% of publishers (11 out of 1,125) produce 41% of total articles and are present   in 46% of observations of the Top Stories panel.           the number of sources in the 3rd position is more than double that of sources in the 1st position.                       RQ3: Evidence about the potential of using audit results from news aggregation platforms (e.g., Google) to answer questions relevant to media communication theory such as media selection bias (e.g., which publishers cover which stories)                    What events or people are publishers choosing to report on any given day?           e.g. the top sources for the query “hilary clinton” were “Washington Examiner” and “Fox News”           “selection bias”  is indeed observed through hierarchal clustering of 65 publishers.

What will be true of study results?  I chose: Neither of the above  Right answer: We can conclude that single-sex v. coed classroom type causes any differences in outcomes  I thought that “outcome” implied the target population, but it just means our sample, and since we randomized treatment, we can reach this conclusion.      Q7:  Based on those same two paragraphs, what value of the test statistic is the cutoff for rejecting the null?  I chose:6  Right answer:8  Didn’t read the article thoroughly…      Q10:  Suppose that you conducted a randomized experiment, assigning 50 people to treatment and 50 people to control by drawing names from a hat. After collecting outcomes, you conduct a randomization test, using the ratio of the two group medians as a test statistic. What is the simplest way to generate a reference distribution?  I chose:Approximating the reference distribution with a normal distribution with a certain mean and variance  Right answer:Randomly simulating 1000 ways to assign 100 people to two groups of 50  simplest way would be SRS. Also, there is no guarantee that the reference distribution is normal, and even if it is, not clear how we’ll come up with the mean and variance because we’re not using rank sum test.       2 RailTrail Dataset  library(mosaicData) dim(RailTrail) ## [1] 90 11 #head(RailTrail,20) RailTrail[1:20,-1:-5] ##    fall cloudcover precip volume weekday dayType ## 1     0        7.6   0.00    501    TRUE weekday ## 2     0        6.3   0.29    419    TRUE weekday ## 3     0        7.5   0.32    397    TRUE weekday ## 4     0        2.6   0.00    385   FALSE weekend ## 5     0       10.0   0.14    200    TRUE weekday ## 6     0        6.6   0.02    375    TRUE weekday ## 7     0        2.4   0.00    417    TRUE weekday ## 8     0        0.0   0.00    629   FALSE weekend ## 9     0        3.8   0.00    533   FALSE weekend ## 10    0        4.1   0.00    547    TRUE weekday ## 11    0        8.5   0.00    432    TRUE weekday ## 12    0        7.2   0.00    418    TRUE weekday ## 13    0       10.0   0.03    193    TRUE weekday ## 14    1        7.7   0.00    331    TRUE weekday ## 15    1        5.8   0.00    280    TRUE weekday ## 16    0        3.6   0.00    304    TRUE weekday ## 17    0        6.1   0.68    352   FALSE weekend ## 18    0        6.3   0.00    156    TRUE weekday ## 19    0        8.6   0.00    365    TRUE weekday ## 20    1       10.0   0.15    181    TRUE weekday summary(RailTrail) ##     hightemp        lowtemp         avgtemp          spring       ##  Min.   :41.00   Min.   :19.00   Min.   :33.00   Min.   :0.0000   ##  1st Qu.:59.25   1st Qu.:38.00   1st Qu.:48.62   1st Qu.:0.0000   ##  Median :69.50   Median :44.50   Median :55.25   Median :1.0000   ##  Mean   :68.83   Mean   :46.03   Mean   :57.43   Mean   :0.5889   ##  3rd Qu.:77.75   3rd Qu.:53.75   3rd Qu.:64.50   3rd Qu.:1.0000   ##  Max.   :97.00   Max.   :72.00   Max.   :84.00   Max.   :1.0000   ##      summer            fall          cloudcover         precip        ##  Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :0.00000   ##  1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.: 3.650   1st Qu.:0.00000   ##  Median :0.0000   Median :0.0000   Median : 6.400   Median :0.00000   ##  Mean   :0.2778   Mean   :0.1333   Mean   : 5.807   Mean   :0.09256   ##  3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:0.0000   3rd Qu.: 8.475   3rd Qu.:0.02000   ##  Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :10.000   Max.   :1.49000   ##      volume       weekday          dayType          ##  Min.   :129.0   Mode :logical   Length:90          ##  1st Qu.:291.5   FALSE:28        Class :character   ##  Median :373.0   TRUE :62        Mode  :character   ##  Mean   :375.4                                      ##  3rd Qu.:451.2                                      ##  Max.   :736.0 hist(RailTrail$avgtemp, main=&quot;Frequency of Temperature&quot;, xlab=&quot;Average Temperature&quot;)   boxplot(RailTrail$volume, RailTrail$weekday, names=c(&#39;weekday&#39;,&#39;weekend&#39;),main=&quot;Number of Trail Users by Type of Day&quot;,ylab=&quot;volume (# of trail users)&quot;)    different plot 1  par(mfrow=c(1,2)) hist(RailTrail$volume[RailTrail$weekday == TRUE],main=&quot;weekday&quot;,xlab=&quot;volume&quot;) hist(RailTrail$volume[RailTrail$weekday == FALSE],main=&quot;weekends&quot;,xlab=&quot;volume&quot;) mtext(&quot;Frequency of Trail User Volume by Day Type&quot;,line=-1, side=3, outer=TRUE)     different plot 2  daycolor=ifelse(RailTrail$weekday == TRUE, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) plot(RailTrail$avgtemp,RailTrail$volume, main=&quot;Effect of Temperature on Trail Volume&quot;,xlab=&quot;average temperature (F)&quot;, ylab=&quot;volume (# of trail users)&quot;, col=daycolor) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;,col=c(&quot;red&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;),legend=c(&quot;weekday&quot;,&quot;weekend&quot;), pch =1 )      3  Consider a research project that you have worked on or thought about recently. Perhaps it’s a study you read about in the news. Answer each of the questions below in a sentence or two, or guess and discuss if you are not sure.  (a) Briefly describe the project and its goals.  Project: Wellesley Cred Lab Paper I read recently – The Media Coverage of the 2020 US Presidential Election Candidates through the Lens of Google’s Top Stories  (b) How is a “unit” defined?  Article in the Google Top Stories panel  (c) What is the target population?  Article in the Google Top Stories panel when the query searched on Google is a US presidential election candidate name  (d) What is the sample population?  Google Top Stories panel of politicians involved in the 202 US Presidential Election  (e) What is the sample? How is the sample selected from the sample population? Briefly discuss any possible sources of selection bias.  Google Top Stories panel of 30 US presidential election candidate names. Looked through sports betting websites / articles to manually select 30 names that were rumored to run for the presdiential election. Selection bias: the data collection might have missed a few names, since out of the 60 people that the websites were guessing might run for presidency, only 30 people were selected.  (f) Is there any non-response? Briefly discuss any possible sources of non-response bias.  I guess there is no non-response in this case, since there has to be a search result page that shows up when the automated browser searches a candidate name on Google.  (g) If you are comparing multiple groups, how are units assigned to groups? Briefly discuss any possible sources of bias due to the group assignments.  Individually search the 30 names, so there are no groups.  (h) Carefully state a definition for your study’s estimand; if you’re not sure of your project’s primary goal, specify a possible estimand. What are the reasons that your estimate will differ from the estimand?  Since the RQ is “which news stories are chosen to appear in Top stories and why?”, the estimand the authors are looking for is the news stories in the Top stories for all US Presidential candiates all time. But since the authors can’t infinitely search on Google, the estimate would be to just search the names in an automated browser a few times a day, for a set number of months.  (i) Can you think of any ethical concerns related to this study?  Since the study is scraping the internet, a ethical concern would be copyright – the reporters that wrote the articles or the publisher do not know they were part of the study.    4  (a) Having signs up don’t look that significant, since 160 &gt; 140 although 100 is the smallest out of the four.

Non-parametric test: next steps: 1. lots of assumptions 2. randomization test: take advantage of the fact that we randomized the test 3. permutation test is equivalent: apply the algo for randomization test for a situation where we did not randomize 4. benefits: useful for any sample scheme, any sample size. you can also use any test statistic. No distributional assumptions such as normality.   Q: Can we carry out the steps of a randomization test if the study was not actually randomized?   A: Yes. The steps in the test work perfectly will if the two groups were not created randomly. However, in that case we can’t justify the test by saying that each of these other randomizations could have occurred if the groups did not cause the outcome. Instead, we justify the test by saying that the group labels could have been allocated in any of these ways if the outcomes are not related to the groups.   Rank Sum Tests      Rank sum test            ex setup: suppose we compare the effectiveness of the old drug and the new drug. Suppose we measure how many months they lived after we assign the drugs. 4 ppl.       2 ppl for old drug A lived 3, 7 months each       new drug B lived 0, 12 months                    3 7 0 12           A A B B           A B A B           .. continue random allocation → make histogram of  difference of means → get p value                       what if instead of 12 months, it’s &gt;12? (person’s still alive)…what do we do?           Rank sum test details            we can’t take mean of 0 and &gt; 12. so instead, w.t. transform our data so that we can represent &gt;12 in a useful way — convert to numbers rank in dataset.       back to example                    3 7 0 &gt;12 (assigned)           2 3 1 4 (ranks) → T (add ranks of ppl in group A)           A A B B → 5           A B A B  → 3           A B B A  → 6           B B A A →  5           B A B A  → 7           B A A B → 4                       T = sum of the ranks in the smaller group. We now have reference distribution!       The randomization we actually saw (data) is the first row. → Q: are we surprised to see a rank sum of 5 if null is true? No! bc the 5 is the middle value i expect to see           Why sum of ranks?            the test statistics we used was sum of ranks instead of diff of means.       suppose the values was 3 3 0 &gt; 12. Then you average the ranks: 2.5 2.5 1 4       If I know there’s 4 nums, we know there are 4 ranks. If I know sum is 10 (1+2+3+4), and the sum of ranks in group A is 5, I know that the sum of ranks in group B is 5. So I just have to keep track of 1 group.           When to use the rank sum            when you have censored data (very common in medical data like &gt;12)       when you have outliers: when you have 120000 instead of 12: if you take average with this, this outlier will completely drive the output. This rank sum test is resistant to outliers.       when you have small dataset bc no assumptions (e.g. normal distribution). Other methods, like t-tests, estimate the reference distribution by making assumptions.           More Non-parametric Tests      Ways to approximate the reference distribution, rather than calculating it exactly            exact method                    (what we’ve been doing) listing all ways to allocate units into 2 groups. AAABB, AABAB, …           problem: too many ways to allocate units                       approximate exact:                    take a SRS of the ways to allocate the units into 2 groups. Use those allocations only to produce an approximation to the exact reference distribution           most common plan                       normal approximation:                    works sometimes, only if the mean and variance of the reference distribution is known ahead of time, and we know the reference distribution would be normal.           workers for rank sum bc “expected value” E(T)  = n_1(N+1)/2, var(T) = n_1n_2(N+1)/12           Y: -20, -11, 5,7, …, 2100, 3000           rank: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …, 99, 100           treat: A, A, B, A, …, A,B           rank depends on N, not data values           uniform reference distribution: we know the distribution (histogram) of the ranks without seeing the data → just flat bc there’s one of each rank                           Central Limit Theorem            If you get the rank sum distributoin from the uniform rank distribution, it looks like a normal distribution.       def: regardless of population distribution, sum of random samples will be approximately normally distributed (in most circumstances)       but then why is it helpful that converting to ranks gives us a uniform distribution?       CLT says when we draw a large sample from a data set and record the sum (or mean) of the values in the sample, if we repeatedly draw different samples, the sums (or means) will look approximately normal. However, the meaning of the word “large” depends on the distribution of the original data: the weirder the distribution, the larger sample size we need in order for the CLT to be true. So, the advantage of converting the data to ranks is that we know the uniform distribution is not too weird (no outliers, symmetric), and the CLT will work even for a small sample size.           Facts about rank sum            no distributional assumptions       outliers are not a problem       censoring not a problem       randomization/permutation distribution depends on the sample size, not the data itself       big or small sample size is fine       when to avoid rank sum:                    lots of ties                           ","categories": ["R"],
